My web application that implements a RestAPI application based on the proposed pattern using Node.js, Express.js and Sequelize that allows users to create, read, update and delete items in the store. 
Use '/api/v1/products' as root url for products. Then '/api/v1/products/:id' should be used for requests that require id of product.
